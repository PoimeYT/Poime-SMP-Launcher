This is not an exhaustive list.

## Downloads

You can download from the Discord server! (If your a normal person, f*ck off, you cannot download this launcher and find the IP)

**Supported Platforms**
Windows, MacOS and Linux

| Platform | File |
| -------- | ---- |
| Windows x64 | `PSMP-Launcher-setup-VERSION.exe` |
| macOS x64 (Intel Chip) | `PSMP-Launcher-setup-VERSION-x64.dmg` |
| macOS arm64 (Apple Chip) | `PSMP-Launcher-setup-VERSION-arm64.dmg` |
| Linux x64 | `PSMP-Launcher-setup-VERSION.AppImage` |

## Console

To open the console, use the following keybind.

```console
ctrl + shift + i
```

Ensure that you have the console tab selected. Do not paste anything into the console unless you are 100% sure of what it will do. Pasting the wrong thing can expose sensitive information.

## Development (mainly for me to read back on)

**Build Installers**

To build for your current platform.

```console
> npm run dist
```

Build for a specific platform.

| Platform    | Command              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Windows x64 | `npm run dist:win`   |
| macOS       | `npm run dist:mac`   |
| Linux x64   | `npm run dist:linux` |

Builds for macOS may not work on Windows/Linux and vice-versa.
